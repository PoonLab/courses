# Writing maintainable code

## What is maintainable code?

Maintainable code can be read by another person, who will be able to:
1. use your code with confidence that it is doing what they expect it to;
2. understand it well enough to modify it without breaking something.   

Even if you don't intend for anyone else to use your code, you will always be writing it for someone else: *you*.  Months from now when you return to your code, if your code hasn't been written to be maintainable then you will have created a "black box" for yourself.
