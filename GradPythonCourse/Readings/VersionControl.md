# Version control with git

## What is version control?

There are several situations where a script evolves through different versions of itself.  As you're developing the script, you will often need to spend time shaking out the bugs.  When you've written a script, you might need to adapt it to a related but slightly different computing problem.  In the latter case, it is tempting to keep multiple versions of the script on your computer as separate files with slightly different names.

The situation gets even more difficult when you are collaborating with another developer.  

If you're new to programming and working in UNIX-like systems, then you are probably most familiar with the concept of version control through some system like Microsoft Word's *Track Changes* feature.
