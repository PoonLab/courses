# Bioinformatic data formats

## Binary and text files
First, let's draw a distinction between plain text and binary files.  All files correspond to a series of 1's and 0's on the hard drive or in memory.  A plain text file has a flag that tells the computer that it should apply a [character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) that maps binary sequences (bit strings) to symbols, such as characters in an alphabet.  For example, the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) encoding maps the bit string `1001010` to the letter `J`.  This means that when you open the file, the computer knows that it should display its contents as a collection of meaningful characters.  Obviously this is a big advantage for making a file immediately interpretable.  However, we sacrifice some efficiency to make this possible, so binary files tend to be more compact while storing the same information. 

For a plain text file, a format is a set of rules about how the characters are arranged to encode information.
