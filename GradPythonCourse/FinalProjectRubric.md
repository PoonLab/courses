# Final Project Grading Rubric

For your final project, please submit:
* One or more Python or bash scripts that accomplish the objectives set out in your proposal.  
* Provide the raw data if possible - if not, then submit a truncated version with reduced file sizes.  
* Provide full or truncated outputs.
* Write a `README.md` Markdown file that documents the purpose of each script.


**Due date:** July 11, 2017
Submit to Dr. Poon by e-mail.  Late penalties will apply.
We take VISA and MasterCard.

**Total score:** 50

## Comprehension (20)

* Does the source code use multiple concepts in Python scripting from the course?  These may include some (not necessarily all of) the following:
  * file input/output
  * `for` loops
  * indexing and slicing iterable Python objects
  * string operations
  * writing formatted strings
  * parsing tabular data
  * parsing common genetic sequence formats (FASTA, FASTQ, SAM)
  * regular expressions with `re`
  * batch scripting with `glob`
  * pipelining with `subprocess`
  * scraping with `urllib` and `bs4`

* Do the scripts integrate different concepts to accomplish a task?


## Objectives (10)

* Are the scripts appropriate for achieving the proposed objectives?
* Are the objectives achieved?


## Difficulty (5)

* This category exists to recognize students who are attempting more difficult tasks.
* However, these tasks should also be realistic, *i.e.*, feasible in the allotted time.
* More difficult tasks:
  * Scraping a website not covered in class
  * Composing a new, complex regular expression
  * Building a pipeline integrating multiple programs with `subprocess`, with exchange and conversion of inputs and outputs handled by Python
* Less difficult tasks:
  * Employing basic UNIX commands, *e.g.*, `ls`, `cp`
  * Reading lines from a tabular CSV data set - subsequent processing of these data may qualify as more difficult


## Documentation (5)

* Does the `README.md` provide adequate documentation for me to understand what the scripts are trying to accomplish and how they work?


## Style (10)

* Does the code contain sufficient commenting and documentation?
* Is the code readable?
* Are there appropriate variable names?
