## A brief tour of tabular data in bioinformatics and medical sciences

### NCBI ClinVar
[ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) is NCBI's web portal to query their curated database of associations between variants in the human genome (alleles) and phenotypes (measurable characteristics).  Results from a ClinVar database query can be saved to your computer as a plain-text file in a tab-separated values (TSV) tabular format.  Here is a snippet of the results when querying `BRCA2`, which returns a table of all variants within the BRCA2 gene and their clinical associations:
```
Name	Gene(s)	Condition(s)	Frequency	Clinical significance (Last reviewed)	Review status	Chromosome	Location	Assembly	VariationID	AlleleID(s)	
NM_000059.3:c.156_157insAlu	BRCA2	Breast-ovarian cancer, familial 2		Pathogenic	no assertion criteria provided			GRCh38	403703	390673

Note that this data file contains a header row.

## Review: parsing a tabular data file in Python

Here is a basic skeleton of a script that opens a file and attempts to read data from it by assuming that it is in a tabular data format:
```python
# set the character or substring we're going to use to 
delimiter ='\t'

# open a stream to the file in read mode
handle = open('file.tsv', 'rU')

# if we want to skip a header row, we need to advance one line in the stream
_ = handle.readline()

#for line in handle.readlines():
for line in handle:  # this is equivalent to the above statement
    # remove the line break and break the remaining string down to a list of values
    values = line.strip('\n').split('\t')
    # do stuff with values here

# tidy up after ourselves
handle.close()
```
This isn't by any means the only way to write this sort of script, and it's far from the best (for one thing, there's no handling of values enclosed in double-quotes).  I'm only using this as a foundation for reviewing some of the basic concepts we've covered so far.  In a later section, I'll talk about a better way of handling tabular data in Python (with the *csv* module).

Recall that a tabular data format is generally defined by separating table rows into different lines in the file, and separating the values within each row (table columns) with a delimiter.  This example script opens the file, pops the first line off as a header row, and then loops through the remaining lines in the file until it reaches the end.  Each line is broken up into pieces (substrings) that get assigned to a list.  

Iteration over the file handle (looping over lines) plays a key role in our script.  
```python
for line in handle:  # this is equivalent to the above statement
```
An open file stream in Python is an iterable object.  Looping over the lines of a file is such a common task that it just made sense to incorporate this into the behaviour of a file stream object; in other words, you don't have to call its `readlines()` function.

This isn't the only iterable object that we're dealing with in this script.  There's also an iterable object being returned from this line:
```python
values = line.strip('\n').split('\t')
```
The `split` function returns a list comprising all the substrings produced by cutting the original string wherever the delimiter occurs.  Since we're already dealing with two iterable objects, I think it makes sense to expand on what these are and how we work with them.


## Iterables

An iterable object in Python is an ordered sequence of other objects.
