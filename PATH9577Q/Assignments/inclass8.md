Zika virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that is associated with microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome in adults (although its pathogenesis remains undetermined).  Global awareness of Zika virus has grown in association with recent outbreaks in Brazil and subsequent spread to other countries.  As of June 19, 2018, NCBI Genbank held roughly 1,100 Zika virus sequence records.  You can obtain a compressed data dump of these records here.
