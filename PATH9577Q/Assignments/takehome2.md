# Take home assignment 2

1. Using Python as a calculator, add 100 and 80, divide the result by 6, and multiply by 12.  (Fun fact, this is based on a skill testing question that someone needed to win a video game console in Mississauga.)
```python
# paste your work here

```

2. Find a simple arithmetic operation with two numbers (`int` or `float`) that yields a float with a machine precision error, other than the one that was given as an example in class.  Use built-in functions in Python to round this quantity to the nearest integer.  
```python
# paste your work here

```

3. Assign the quoted text below to a string variable `haiku`, with line breaks intact (note, line breaks might not render in HTML; do not include `>` or `<br/>` symbols, the latter are just there to force line breaks within the quote):
   > Antenna searches.<br/>
   > Retriever's nose in the wind.<br/>
   > Ether's far secrets.<br/>
```python
# paste your work here

print(haiku)  # run to display contents of haiku
```

4. Split the `haiku` string on the line breaks `\n` and assign the second item to a new variable, `line`.
```python
# paste your work here

print(line)  # run to display line
```

5. Assign the position of the apostrophe `'` in `line` a new variable `index`.  Slice `line` from `index` to the end and assign the resulting substring to `subline`.
```python
# paste your work here

print(subline)  # run to display result
```

6. Manually build up a dictionary with the line number for every word that appears in `haiku`.  For example, the dictionary should contain the key-value pair `wind: 1`.  (Remember that Python is zero-indexed.)
```python
# paste your work here

```
