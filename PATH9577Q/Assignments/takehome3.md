# Take-home 3

1. Open a new text file.  Copy and paste the following:
   ```python
   import sys
   
   def main():
       print(sys.argv)
   
   if __name__ == '__main__'
       main()
   ```
   Modify the `main function of this script so that it iterates over the contents of `sys.argv` and prints each member to the console.
