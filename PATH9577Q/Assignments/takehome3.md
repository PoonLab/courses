# Take-home 3

1. Open a new text file called `tka3.py`.  Copy and paste the following:
   ```python
   import sys
   
   def main():
       print(sys.argv)
   
   if __name__ == '__main__'
       main()
   ```
   This is a standard structure for a Python script that can potentially be imported into another script: the `main` function is only run if we call `tka3.py` directly on the command line.  Modify the `main` function of this script so that it iterates over the contents of `sys.argv` and prints each member to the console, and copy the result below:+
   ```python
   # paste your code here
   ```

2. Now we're going to define a new function called `scramble`.  This function should take a single argument, check that it is a string, and then collect all the odd-indexed and even-indexed characters into two separate substrings, and return the concatenation of these substrings.  For example, `pizza` should return as `pziza`.  Add this code after the first `import sys` line and copy the result below:
  ```python
  import sys
  # paste your code here
  ```
