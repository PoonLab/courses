# Take-home 3

1. Open a new text file called `tka3.py`.  Copy and paste the following:
   ```python
   import sys
   
   def main():
       print(sys.argv)
   
   if __name__ == '__main__'
       main()
   ```
   This is a standard structure for a Python script that can potentially be imported into another script: the `main` function is only run if we call `tka3.py` directly on the command line.  Modify the `main` function of this script so that it iterates over the contents of `sys.argv` and prints each member to the console, and copy the result below:+
   ```python
   # paste your code here
   ```
