If I've given you a user account on one of my lab Linux workstations, then you can use the following instructions to log in.  I'm providing this service as a last resort option for students who only have access to a Windows laptop.

1. If you haven't already done so, install a telnet client for Windows such as [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/).  The rest of these instructions will be assuming that you're running PuTTY, but the general idea should apply to other clients.
2. Open your telnet client.  The configuration window should appear:

3. Under host name, enter the following [IP address](): `129.100.26.154`.
4. Make sure that Port is set to `22` and that the radio button for `SSH` is selected under Protocol.  Press the `Open` button.
5. The following window might pop up if this is your first time logging into this machine:

 Select `Yes`

6. You will be prompted for your username and password.  Enter them to log into the system.
