This is a Markdown document that provides a basic example of a project proposal for this course.
The purpose of this exercise is:
1. To have students start thinking about how they want to apply the bioinformatics skills that they will acquire during the course to their own graduate research project.
2. To provide some immediate feedback about what specific skills the students want to acquire during the course.
3. To learn Markdown, a simple markup language that will introduce some basic concepts in writing a formally-structured text document with a defined syntax.


# An informative title

## Background
* Brief (5-10 lines) description of the research topic.

## Data
* A rough description of the data set that will be analyzed, comprising:
  * Number of observations/records
  * Number and brief description of each variable - if there is a large number of the same type of variable, then describe them in aggregate
  * Data format, if known

## Objectives
* A short list of things that you would like to accomplish with these data.  These objectives should be feasible in the time frame of the course and with the skills that you are going to acquire in the course.
* For example:
  * filtering a subset of observations from the data based on some criteria;
  * filter a subset of variables from the data
  * converting a data file into another format; 
  * automating the batch processing of many data files with another program;
  * merging two data files of different formats and content
