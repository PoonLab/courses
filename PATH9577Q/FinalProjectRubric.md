# Final Project Grading Rubric

For your final project, please submit:
* One or more Python or bash scripts to analyze your data.  
* Provide the raw data if possible - if not, then submit a truncated version with reduced file sizes.  
* Provide full or truncated outputs.
* Write a `README.md` Markdown file that documents the purpose of each script.

**Due date:** first Friday of August, 2018
Submit to Dr. Poon by e-mail.  Late penalties will apply.

**Total score:** 40

## Comprehension (20)

* Does the source code use multiple concepts in Python scripting from the course?  These may include some (not necessarily all of) the following:
  * file input/output
  * `for` loops
  * indexing and slicing iterable Python objects
  * string operations
  * writing formatted strings
  * parsing tabular data
  * parsing common genetic sequence formats
  * regular expressions with `re`
  * batch scripting with `glob`
  * pipelining with `subprocess`
* Do the scripts integrate different concepts to accomplish a task?
* Does the choice of methods make sense for the task being attempted?

## Documentation (5)
* Does the `README.md` provide adequate documentation for me to understand what the scripts are trying to accomplish and how they work?
* Are docstrings and inline comments used appropriately?

## Style (10)
* Does the code contain sufficient commenting and documentation?
* Is the code readable?
* Are there appropriate variable names?

## Difficulty (5)
* This category exists to recognize students who are attempting more difficult tasks.
* However, these tasks should also be realistic, *i.e.*, feasible in the allotted time.
